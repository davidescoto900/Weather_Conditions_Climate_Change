# Weather_Conditions_Climate_Change

## Oberview 
This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning analysis focused on understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change in Europe. Acting as a data analyst for the fictitious nonprofit ClimateWins, I apply both foundational and advanced machine learning techniques to real-world weather data collected from 18 stations across Europe, spanning from the late 1800s to 2022. The project’s primary goal is to investigate the recent rise in extreme weather events and to assess how machine learning can help forecast patterns such as pleasant or hazardous weather days.

## Data Sources
The data used for this project consists of weather observations from 18 weather stations across Europe. The data has been collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset project ](https://www.ecad.eu/) and includes daily observations from 1960 through most of 2022.

## Key Questions 
● How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?

● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are
there any concerns specific to this project?

● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?

● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on
a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)

## Folders 
The folders in this project include the scripts used to implement the required machine learning methods, which can be found in the Project_Scripts folder, as well as the analysis of each topic, located in the Project_Analyses folder.
